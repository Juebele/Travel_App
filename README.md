## Purpose
    We made this app to practice building a sophisticated full-stack web application.
## Function
    Use the signup button at the top right to create a new account. 
    Once you have an account, you can log in using the credentials you set.
    When logged in, you will be taken to your trips dashboard, which allows you to create a new trip and view or edit existing trips.


## Deployment

Deployed App on Heroku: https://travel-app-gt.herokuapp.com/ 

Github Repository: https://github.com/Juebele/Travel_App


## Future Plans
    This application was built in just over a week. If we had more time, we would have added even more features.

    We would have liked to add third-party APIs that facilitate planning. Ideally, you would be able to browse local experiences through Groupon or something similar. Adding a search function for flights and hotel stays would also be a major improvement, especially if the user could book directly with the provider.
